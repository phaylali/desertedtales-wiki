Zoulaikha bint Mohamed ben Si Abdelkader was born on August 5, 1542, to Mohamed ben Si Abdelkader and Amani bint Elikia. As the eldest child among her three siblings, Zoulaikha felt a sense of responsibility from a young age to help care for her family. 

As a young miss, Zoulaikha was a wise and gentle soul who had already developed a range of domestic skills. She loved helping her mother with tasks such as weaving and cooking, and was often tasked with preparing meals for the family. 

Zoulaikha's younger brother Ali looked up to her as a role model, and she enjoyed taking him on adventures around the city and teaching him about the world. Despite their age difference, the two siblings were incredibly close, and Zoulaikha was always willing to lend a helping hand or offer guidance when needed. 

Physically, Zoulaikha was a slender young girl, standing at about 147cm tall and weighing around 45kg. Her bright brown eyes sparkled with intelligence as she navigated the world around her. 

In many ways, Zoulaikha was already a mini-version of her mother - kind, compassionate, and wise beyond her years. Her parents were proud of the young woman she was growing into, and had high hopes for her future.
