Meryem was born on September 23, 1518, in Mazagan (modern-day El Jadida), Morocco. She is one of the siblings of Mohamed, who is the eldest child of Lalla Zahra and Si Abdelkader. 

Physically, Meryem stood at 160 cm tall with a slender build, weighing approximately 60 kg. Her dark hair was often worn in intricate braids, framing her sharp facial features. Her bright brown eyes sparkled with knowledge and wisdom, reflecting her exceptional skills as a teacher and historian. 

Meryem's love for learning began at a young age. She spent hours poring over ancient texts, studying the properties of various plants, metals, and other substances. She was particularly fascinated by the works of ancient civilizations, and spent many years studying the art of metallurgy, herbology, and engineering. 

However, Meryem's true passion lay in sharing her knowledge with others, especially the children of Mazagan. As a respected teacher and historian, she dedicated herself to educating the young people of the city about their rich history and culture. She believed that it was essential for them to understand their heritage, so they wouldn't forget who they were and where they came from. 

In an effort to combat the Portuguese propaganda that had been spreading false information about the people of Mazagan, Meryem worked tirelessly to teach children about their own history and traditions. She would often take groups of students on walks through the city, pointing out ancient landmarks and sharing stories about the great leaders who had once ruled over their land. 

Meryem's lessons were not just informative, but also inspiring. She instilled in her students a sense of pride and identity that would stay with them for the rest of their lives. Her teaching style was engaging, and she made complex historical concepts accessible to even the youngest learners. 

Her expertise lay in understanding the tactics and strategies employed by their ancestors and ancient civilizations in combating foreign threats and colonizers. She had spent years studying the legends of Islamic golden eras, such as Tariq Ibn Ziyad and Khalid bin al-Walid, who had successfully defended their territories against invaders. 

Meryem also drew upon her knowledge of Amazigh and Arab leaders who had fought bravely against foreign occupation. Her insights into the strategies employed by these legendary leaders were crucial in informing Aicha's decision-making process as she led the resistance movement. 

As Aicha sought to mobilize support for their cause, Meryem provided invaluable guidance on how to employ tactics that had proven effective in the past. She drew upon her vast knowledge of history to help Aicha understand the importance of unity, strategic planning, and perseverance in the face of adversity. 

Through Meryem's contributions, the resistance movement was able to tap into a rich vein of historical knowledge that had been passed down through generations. Her expertise helped inform Aicha's leadership, allowing them to make more informed decisions and ultimately achieve their goals. 

Meryem's legacy is one of wisdom, compassion, and unwavering dedication to the cause. She played a crucial role in preserving the history and culture of Mazagan, combating the Portuguese propaganda that sought to erase the identity of its people. Her teaching style was inspiring, and her contributions will continue to be felt for generations to come.
