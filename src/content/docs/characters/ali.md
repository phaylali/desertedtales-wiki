Ali ben Mohamed was born on June 2, 1544, to Mohamed ben Si Abdelkader and Amani bint Elikia. As the only son among his three siblings, Ali felt a sense of responsibility from a young age to protect and care for his sisters. 

At a young age, Ali was still a rambunctious boy, always getting into mischief with his sisters Zoulaikha who is 2 years older than him and Amina who is 2 years younger. Despite the age gap, the three siblings were incredibly close, and Ali loved being able to play games and roughhouse with them. However, when it came time for bed, Ali took his duties as big brother very seriously, making sure that his sisters got tucked in safely and on time. 

Zoulaikha, the eldest, was a wise and gentle soul who often helped Ali with his homework and taught him about the importance of being kind to others. Amina, on the other hand, was a tiny ball of energy, always getting into trouble and needing Ali's protection from her own mischievous ways. 

Ali loved spending time with his mother, Amani, who would take him on walks around the city and teach him about the different plants and animals that lived there. He also enjoyed helping his father, Mohamed, in the marketplace, learning how to haggle over prices and make new friends among the vendors. 

Physically, Ali was a sturdy young boy, standing at about 125cm tall and weighing around 35kg. His bright brown eyes sparkled with curiosity as he explored the world around him. Despite his energetic nature, Ali had a kind heart and a strong sense of loyalty to those he cared about. 

Despite being a young boy, Ali was already showing signs of becoming a brave and responsible leader. His sisters looked up to him with admiration, and their parents were proud of the kind and caring big brother he was growing into.
