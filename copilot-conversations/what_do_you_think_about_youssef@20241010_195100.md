**ai**: OK Feel free to ask me questions about your vault: **tales**. 

If you have *NEVER* as your auto-index strategy, you must click the *Refresh Index* button below, or run Copilot command: *Index vault for QA* first before you proceed!

Please note that this is a retrieval-based QA. Specific questions are encouraged. For generic questions like 'give me a summary', 'brainstorm based on the content', Chat mode with *Send Note to Prompt* button used with a *long context model* is a more suitable choice.

**ai**: As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions. However, based on the context of the conversation, it seems that Yusuf is likely a person who has been involved in some sort of conflict or disagreement with someone else. He may be trying to find peace or reconciliation between two parties, or he may simply be seeking understanding and support from others. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences, and it's up to each individual to determine how they want to approach any conflicts or disagreements.
