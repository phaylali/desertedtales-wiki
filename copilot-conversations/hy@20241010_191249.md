**user**: are you good with making novels?
[Timestamp: 2024/10/10 19:14:14]

**ai**: As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to create novels directly. However, I can provide you with some tips and advice on how to write a novel. If you have any specific questions or concerns about writing a novel, feel free to ask!

**user**: how to make ollama use only gpu and not cpu
[Timestamp: 2024/10/10 19:14:51]

**ai**: Ollama is designed to run on both CPU and GPU. However, if you want to force Ollama to use only the GPU, you can do so by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to the index of your GPU.

Here's an example command that sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to 0 (assuming your GPU is connected to your system and has an index of 0):

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ollama serve
```

This command will make Ollama only use the GPU with index 0. If you have multiple GPUs, you can specify their indices separated by commas to make Ollama use all of them.

Note that forcing Ollama to use only the GPU may not always be the best option, as it may reduce performance and increase power consumption. It's generally recommended to let Ollama decide whether to use the CPU or GPU based on its own internal logic.

**ai**: OK Feel free to ask me questions about your vault: **tales**. 

If you have *NEVER* as your auto-index strategy, you must click the *Refresh Index* button below, or run Copilot command: *Index vault for QA* first before you proceed!

Please note that this is a retrieval-based QA. Specific questions are encouraged. For generic questions like 'give me a summary', 'brainstorm based on the content', Chat mode with *Send Note to Prompt* button used with a *long context model* is a more suitable choice.
